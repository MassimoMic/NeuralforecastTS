This endeavor involved the utilization of a dataset characterized by a significant degree of data imbalance. In an effort to develop a model capable of achieving satisfactory, rather than optimal, performance, a library employing Time Series LLMs was investigated. Due to privacy concerns, the dataset employed in this study cannot be made publicly available. This notebook serves as a demonstration of utilizing a dataset with imbalanced data.
